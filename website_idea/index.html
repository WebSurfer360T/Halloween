       <h1> The Halloween: Meaning </h1>
       <p>
         Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of Hallows' Evening), also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve,
         or All Saints' Eve, is a celebration observed in a number of countries on 31 October, the eve of the
         Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide, the time
         in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the
         faithful departed. It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic
         harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain; that such festivals may have had pagan roots; and
         that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church. Some believe,
         however, that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, separate from ancient festivals like Samhain.
         Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising), attending Halloween
         costume parties, carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games,
         playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror films. In many parts of
         the world, the Christian religious observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and
         lighting candles on the graves of the dead, remain popular, although elsewhere it is a more commercial
         and secular celebration. Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a
         tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day, including apples, potato
         pancakes, and soul cakes.

       <h1> The Halloween: For Kids </h1>
       <p>
         Trick-or-treating is a Halloween ritual custom for children and adults in many countries. Children in costumes
         travel from house-to-house, asking for treats with the phrase "Trick or treat". The "treat" is usually some
         form of candy, although in some cultures money is used instead. The "trick" refers to a threat, usually idle,
         to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given. Trick-or-treating usually occurs
         on the evening of October 31. Some homeowners signal that they are willing to hand out treats by putting up
         Halloween decorations outside their doors; others simply leave treats available on their porches for the
         children to take freely.
         In North America, trick-or-treating has been a Halloween tradition since the late 1920s. In Britain and Ireland
         the tradition of going house-to-house collecting food at Halloween goes back at least as far as the 16th century,
         as had the tradition of people wearing costumes at Halloween. In 19th century Britain and Ireland, there are
         many accounts of people going house-to-house in costume at Halloween, reciting verses in exchange for food,
         and sometimes warning of misfortune if they were not welcomed. The Scottish Halloween custom of
         "guising" – children disguised in costume going from house to house for food or money; –
         is first recorded in North America in 1911 in Ontario, Canada. While going house-to-house in costume
         has remained popular among Scots and Irish, the custom of saying "trick or treat" has only recently become common.
         The activity is prevalent in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Puerto Rico,
         and northwestern and central Mexico. In the latter, this practice is called calaverita (Spanish for "sugar skull"),
         and instead of "trick or treat", the children ask ¿me da mi calaverita? ("can you give me my sugar skull?")
         where a calaverita is a small skull made of sugar or chocolate.

       <h1> The Halloween: For the Grown Ups </h1>
       <p>
         Halloween — it’s not just for the kids. Though we all eventually outgrow our trick-or-treating days,
         that doesn’t mean we have to put the holiday behind us entirely. In fact, there may be even more to do on
         Oct. 31 as an adult. Here are just a few of our favorite options. <br> <br> <br>

        Watch a scary movie.
        It’s the easiest solution to still get your spooky fix, and doesn’t involve you leaving your
        couch. Win-win.  <br> <br>

        Binge-watch a season of American Horror Story.
        Want something a bit longer than a movie to keep you busy all Halloween long? Turn on a season of the always-creepy
        American Horror Story for hours of spine shivers.  <br> <br>

        Carve pumpkins.
        If you want to do something that requires a bit (just a bit!) more physical activity than watching a movie,
        pick up a pumpkin and break out your carving knife. You’ll get into the Halloween spirit
        and get an arm workout. <br> <br>

        Go bobbing for apples.
        This is such an autumn activity, but how many people actually do it? Without trick-or-treating,
        now you can try!<br> <br>

        Hit up a hayride.
        Hey, we get it: You want to get out of your house this Halloween. If hayrides are your thing, there’s
        no better night to do it — the window of opportunity is closing as winter approaches.  <br> <br>

        Or hit up a haunted house.
        Another excellent option for a Halloween adventure, because even if it’s run by a bunch of teenagers, a
        haunted house will never fail to make you scream your head off. <br> <br>

        Head to a Halloween party — or host one of your own!
        If you’re afraid of getting scared (we get it), skip the horror and instead celebrate Halloween with
        a party. If you don’t know anyone hosting one, step up to the plate yourself! <br> <br>

        Bake a candy cake.
        Put an adult twist on Halloween candy with a candy-filled cake recipe.
        Tasty and it’ll keep you occupied. <br> <br>

        Put yourself into a sugar coma.
        Baking isn’t your thing? Celebrate Halloween the same way you did post-trick-or-treating:
        by eating an obscene amount of candy (no one said you have to share with trick-or-treaters). <br> <br>

        Hand out candy.
        Passing along your favorite Halloween traditions to the next generation? Well, there’s
        really nothing sweeter, is there? <br> <br>
